		<hr>
		
		<p>Three women are often forced to share a single bed at Kashmir’s lone maternity care hospital. The situation at the overcrowded Lal Ded hospital in Jammu and Kashmir’s summer capital Srinagar is a matter of concern as it threatens the wellbeing of the women who require utmost sanitation and nursing. But a more serious, unnoticed and undiscussed catastrophe has already touched the feet of ailing maternity care service in Kashmir.</p>
		<p>

		Nearly 75 percent women in Srinagar deliver the baby through an abdominal incision rather than a normal vaginal delivery. The surgical procedure called caesarean section, or C-section, is locally known as ‘bod operation’.</p>
		<p>
		The trend is high across the ten districts of Kashmir valley with Srinagar leading the way at an alarming level. The absolute figure of 75 percent may not sound alarming enough, but when compared to other places across the country, this is where Srinagar stands.</p>

		<p>
		The C-section rate in Srinagar is nearly six times higher than the ideal rate of 10 to 15 percent, recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>

		<p>
		The alarming rise in C-section rate came to fore in the National Family Health Survey 4, conducted in the year 2015-16. The survey provides information on population, health and nutrition for India and each of its states and union territories based on various indicators, one of them being the maternity care.</p>

		<h2>Where do you stand?</h2>

		<p>
		Search your district to know the total caesarean section rate there (public and private sector hospitals combined). You can search the state as well to list all its districts at once. You can also sort the rate in increasing or decreasing order.</p>

		<h2>Situation not well across Kashmir</h2>

		<p>
		Jammu and Kashmir’s overall caesarean rate is two to three times higher than the ideal, but not extraordinarily high. It appears in the list of 29 states and union territories at seventh position with total C-section rate of 33.1 percent.</p>

		<p>
		However, the situation is quite alarming in the ten districts of Kashmir valley. Among the 22 districts in Jammu and Kashmir, 10 districts of Kashmir region have the highest C-section rate.</p>

		<p>
		Ten districts of Jammu region and two of Ladakh region trail at a considerably low rate with highest being 28.4 percent in Jammu district and lowest 11.1 percent in Kargil district of Ladakh region.</p>
		<p>

		<p>
		The map of Jammu and Kashmir shows the highest rates of C-section in Kashmir region, lower rates in border areas of Jammu region and Leh district, and the lowest in Kargil district.</p>

		<p>
		Four mountainous districts—Kishtwar, Doda, Ramban and Kargil—fall within the ideal C-section rate of 10 to 15 percent. Moreover, it is evident that the low C-section rates in Jammu and Ladakh regions have brought down the state’s total rate.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="body-text">

		<h2>Steep rise in a decade</h2>

		<p>
		The C-section rate has considerably increased across India, including Jammu and Kashmir, since the survey was last conducted in 2005-06. However, the nation-wide rate has decreased in public sector, but considerably increased in private sector, thereby increasing the total rate.</p>

		<p>
		In Jammu and Kashmir, the total rate and that in private sector have nearly doubled.</p>

		<p>
		The C-section rate in Srinagar in public sector is 70.1 percent, the highest in India. It is nearly six times more than the nation-wide rate of 11.9 percent.</p>

		<h2>Is it required?</h2>

		<p>
		WHO, in its report, says a C-section can save the mother or the unborn baby’s life “if medically justified”.</p>

		<p>
		It says there is no evidence showing the benefits of caesarean delivery for women or infants who do not require the procedure. “As with any surgery, caesarean sections are associated with short and long term risk which can extend many years beyond the current delivery and affect the health of the woman, her child, and future pregnancies,” the report reads.</p>

		<h2>What’s responsible?</h2>

		<p>
		The reasons behind the alarming figure vary widely, from medical complications to fashion, experts say.</p>

		<p>
		Dr. Shahnaz Taing, who heads the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics at Lal Ded hospital, says the C-section rate at the hospital is high as it receives high-risk patients from across Kashmir valley, being the only tertiary care centre in the region.</p>

		<p>
		“So when all these patients are in a very bad condition, it’s risky to operate them in the periphery because they sometimes need multiple blood transfusions… In some cases the baby doesn’t deliver normally, they are also referred here,” she says.</p>

		<p>
		Dr. Shahnaz says another factor contributing to the rising C-section rates is that the young generation is not ready to undergo the labour pain.</p>

		<p>
		“Labour pain is one of the severest pains which a human being can undergo, like breaking at least 40 bones of the body. It’s not like that a patient comes in and delivers. It takes time. Our today’s generation, our girls, they are not ready for it,” she says.</p>

		<p>
		She says the government hospitals in Kashmir lack the facility of Epidural Anesthesia, which makes labour pain easy. Epidurals block the nerve impulses from the lower spinal segments. This results in decreased sensation in the lower half of the body.</p>

		<p>
		Dr. Shahnaz says the labour pain would be tolerable if a patient is administered Epidural Anesthesia. “But such patients need one-to-one observations, you need nursing staff, you need anaesthetist, you need intensive monitoring. It’s not possible here. First, there are a lot of patients here, three women on a single bed, and where from will we get so many anaesthetists, so many sisters, and drugs,” she says.</p>

		<p>
		She says the doctors also face pressure from the patients and their families if the labour prolongs for long.</p>

		<p>
		“Once a patient is in labor for 16 hours, you are under pressure. The families ask why she didn’t deliver yet when they see other patients delivering. They say ‘beware that nothing happens to her’,” Dr. Shahnaz says.</p>

		<p>
		“I am saying in general, there’s family pressure. Definitely we don’t succumb to that pressure, but somewhere we have this in mind that if a woman doesn’t deliver normally for a particular time then better is to give her safe abdominal delivery rather than traumatic vaginal delivery,” she adds.</p>

		<p>
		Dr. Nisar-ul-Hassan, who heads an association of doctors, blames the overburden on the government hospitals for the undue rise in C-section rates. He says a doctor can perform multiple C-sections in the time it takes to monitor a normal delivery.</p>

		<p>
		He accuses the government of being negligent about the issue, saying the postgraduate students perform C-sections at government hospitals to learn the procedure even if a patient does not require it.</p>

		<p>
		However, Dr. Shahnaz refutes the allegations. “It’s not that caesarean is easy. It’s still a risky procedure, it needs anaesthetics, it needs theatre, it needs recovery. It’s not that a doctor just wants to eliminate the burden by operating a patient.”</p>

		<p>
		“Normal delivery, in comparison, is much much easier. Our residents conduct normal delivery while caesarean needs specialists. Sometimes there is a possibility of life threatening complications during caesarean, so consultants need to be present,” she adds.</p>

		<h2>Surge in private sector</h2>

		<p>
		In private hospitals or nursing homes in Srinagar, 94.6 percent births take place through a C-section, the second highest rate in India after Murshidabad in West Bengal.</p>

		<p>
		The rising rate in private sector is a nation-wide trend attributed to non-medical reasons like increasing commercialization of medical services.</p>

		<p>
		Data of both public and private sectors is available for six districts of Kashmir region. The C-section rate is higher in private sector in all six districts.</p>

		<p>
		Dr. Nisar says private hospitals aim for higher profits and a “nexus between doctors and private hospitals” is responsible for the high C-section rates. “So what drives the caesarean is money. It’s always money, financial gains,” he says, adding the doctors earn more money by conducting multiple C-sections than monitoring a single natural birth in the same period of time.</p>

		<p>
		Another reason, he says, is that the doctors in the private hospitals do not have enough time to wait for a patient’s normal delivery due to the dual practice they do. “In Kashmir, there is no segregation of sectors (public and private) like in Delhi,” he says. “The doctors spend only the mornings and evening in the private hospitals.”</p>

		<p>
		Speaking about the lack of awareness among people, Dr. Nisar says a perception has been deliberately generated among women that C-section is a better option as it bypasses the pain and takes less time.</p>

		<p>
		Nawaz Ashraf Mir, administrator at privately-owned Shifa Medical Centre, says nearly 100 women gave birth at the hospital since it opened a year back. Out of them, around 85 women underwent a C-section, making the rate 85 percent.</p>

		<p>
		Mir cites two broad reasons for the high C-section rate.</p>

		<p>
		He says the doctors are not available at the hospital round-the-clock to monitor a normal delivery, which usually takes a long time. They rather conduct C-sections during their visiting hours.</p>

		<p>
		Mir also says many patients prefer to deliver the child through C-section because they see it as a fashion and are not ready to undergo labour pain.</p>
